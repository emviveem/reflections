What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden .git file is added to the concerned directory. We need to do it because that is what makes a directory a git repository, the hidden .git file

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area let us make sort of half commits i.e., commits that don't reflect in the master file. So, any untoward changes can be undone easily.
