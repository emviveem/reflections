When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would do that when I want to commit all my changes and make that visible on github

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I don't know. I'd like it to be automatically actually! :P
